If any list gets too long, then give each thing in the list a priority, sort by the priority, and pick a cut-off point.

1. Write a minimally complete problem statement.
	-As short and simple as possible.
	-If it has any conjunction words, like "and" or "but", split it into two problem statements.
	-If you end up with too many problem statements, group them and/or prioritize them.
	
	
**Try to resist categorizing/grouping/generalizing, and focus on finding uniqueness and a complete data set in this step.	
2. How to get a perspective about your data.
	-List all of the data that is essential to solving the problem.
		-Notice that this forces you to give each one a unique identifier (name, number, serial etc.).
		-This list should also be minimally complete.
	-Write as many other lists of data as possible.
		-Try making a list of the sources of your data, get as creative as possible. Think people, legal, competitors, price, etc..
		-Also consider the data that you don't have that you can get from the real world.
		-Also consider the data that you don't have that you WISH you did, or wish was even possible.
	-For each thing on the list, write the following things next to it.
		-Make a note of what is unique about this data set and what isn't.
		-The type of data. (A count, money, percent, opinion, color, text etc.)
			-Often, there is more than one type. If the distinction is important, instead of one word for the type, make a comma separated list of types (like tags).
		-The count. How many of these data points do we have?
		-The range. What are the range of possible values these could have?
		-Date/Time/Any concept of time you can get.
		-Also consider: source/confidence/error rate/liklihood/interval.

**At this point, if you're not typing this into a spreadsheet, you should be.

3. Start looking for patterns/categories/groups.
	-Try generalizing/grouping in as many ways as you can, but your FIRST ATTEMPT should always be to generalize/group in a way that best summarizes the data.
	-Avoid generalizing/grouping in ways that diminishes accuracy or implies something that is not in the data.
	-Exploit all of the uniqueness that you found above. Uniqueness is a great way to pivot.
	-If you're going to write code to solve the problem when you're done, look for groups that are almost the same.
	-Try to construct a serial number once you're done as a helpful thought experiment.
