Windows Command Prompt (CMD) Tricks


Type "cmd" into the address bar of any explorer window to open cmd in that window


If cmd is disabled, you can still get to it this way:
	(1) Create a text file (on the desktop or wherever) with just one line of text: "cmd"
	(2) Rename that .txt file to .bat
	(3) double-click, or cntrl+shift+double-click, or right-click and run-as-admin



Find out if cmd is running as admin:
	net session
	
	If admin:
		"There are no entries in the list."
	
	If NOT admin:
		"System error 5 has occurred."
		"Access is denied."



Sorting dir:
	"dir | sort" won't work because the date/time/etc appears first.  So...
	dir /b /s | sort

 
Move all cmd output to the clipboard:
	<command> | clip
	or
	dir /b /s | sort | clip
	


Get a list of all apps installed:
	wmic product get name
	or
	wmic product get name | clip
	
	
Get a list of all running processes:
	tasklist
	(or if you want all the details)
	tasklist /v

	
Create a folder named "aux" that cannot be copied/moved/deleted, and only removed by cmd if empty.
	md aux\
	rd aux\
 
 
 Hide a folder even if "show hidden":
	attrib +h +s +r <name>
	attrib -h -s -r <name>
